# Economize
A text based economics simulation game.

Maybe start as a NOBODY. You have NOTHING. You will have to find stuff, make stuff or something third to start making money. When you get enough to start investing, that's where the game will take off.

You'll be able to play the game as a Investor (legit), a shady person (Drug trade) or something in between (Gus from Breaking Bad). 

* Have a restricted amount of "time" (something like 10 moves pr day)
* Economics based on random events?
  * Maybe make it a "News article"
  * Maybe you can spend some time to look at what might happen, What stock or item might fall in price/value, when, why and the percentage (this might be a buyable skill) of the likelihood of this happening.

<summary>Should this game have XP?</summary>

Should this game have XP? How could this be useful in game?
Maybe.

It could be nice to have skills (Experience). Because the more you do something, the better you get at it. So if you've been doing the economics stuff for 6 years, you would have 6 years experience. But that doesn't mean you're better then this another person with the same amount of years (You can get more/less XP for the amount of stuff being traded (example 99 stocks give more experience than 2, but this shouldn't give that much XP so people doesn't just buy and trade a bunch of cheep stocks/items in the beginning), successful trades, amount of trades that day, ) 

You would get the XP when the day ends, you will be able to spend your skill points (Experience points) after each day, and maybe buy some other stuff if you don't have any skill points (Experience points)
